# Feature Migration Plan: homely-quad-mobile → homely-quad-next

**Document Version**: 1.6  
**Created**: November 2, 2025  
**Last Updated**: November 2, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 5 Complete ✅ | Phase 4 Complete ✅ | Phase 1.5 Complete ✅

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased approach to migrate all features from the standalone `homely-quad-mobile` application to the monorepo structure in `homely-quad-next`, specifically targeting:
- `homely-quad-next/packages/web` (Next.js web application)
- `homely-quad-next/packages/mobile` (React Native mobile app)

The migration will preserve all existing functionality while leveraging the new monorepo architecture with shared components, types, and business logic.

## Migration Strategy

### Shared Resources Approach
The monorepo structure allows for maximum code reuse:

```
homely-quad-next/packages/shared/
├── schema.ts              # Drizzle ORM schema (already exists)
├── types/                 # Shared TypeScript types
├── api/                   # API client utilities
├── hooks/                 # React hooks (usePlatform, etc.)
├── utils/                 # Helper functions
└── constants/             # Shared constants
```

### Platform-Specific Implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Breaking changes in dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Lock dependency versions, thorough testing

**Risk**: Data inconsistency during backend integration
- **Mitigation**: Use existing Drizzle schema, validate all API calls

**Risk**: Platform-specific bugs
- **Mitigation**: Extensive cross-platform testing, platform detection utilities

### Timeline Risks

**Risk**: Underestimated complexity
- **Mitigation**: Buffer time in schedule, prioritize core features

**Risk**: Scope creep
- **Mitigation**: Strict phase definitions, regular reviews
